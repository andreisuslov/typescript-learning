# typescript-learning

Here I store my TS coding notes and projects.

Maps App: the idea of this app is to take a randomly generated user and a company and then add them as markers 📍 on the map 🗺️. If user clicks on on marker, the relevant information will pop up.

Sort App: this app is able to take 3 kinds of data structures (array of numbers, string, linked list) and sort each of them from least to greatest using Abstract classes, inheritance, and Interfaces to avoid code repetition.

Stats App: this app takes a table in csv format, loads it, then after it parses and analyses the data, it produces report. ([CSV]->[LOAD]->[PARSE]->[ANALYZE]->[REPORT])
