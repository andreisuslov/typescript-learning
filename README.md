# typescript-learning

Here I store my TS coding notes and projects.

Maps App: the idea of this app is to take a randomly generated user and a company and then add them as markers 📍 on the map 🗺️. If user clicks on on marker, the relevant information will pop up.

Sort App: this app is able to take 3 kinds of data structures (array of numbers, string, linked list) and sort each of them from least to greatest using Abstract classes, inheritance, and Interfaces to avoid code repetition.
